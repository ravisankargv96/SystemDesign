## Protocols (Mastering System Design) 🗒️

This section focuses on the **core communication protocols** used in modern system architecture. The goal is to understand how these protocols work, when to use them, and their real-world application in system design for web applications, APIs, and real-time communications.


### Section Agenda 📚

The section will cover the following topics across six lectures:

- **Lecture 1: TCP & UDP**    
    - Understanding the basics, differences, and use cases for these foundational protocols.
- **Lecture 2: HTTP**
    - Diving into HTTP, described as the "backbone of the web".
- **Lecture 3: REST & RESTfulness**
    - Exploring API design principles using REST.
- **Lecture 4: Real-Time Communication Protocols**
    - Covering protocols like **WebSockets** and **Long Polling**.
- **Lecture 5: Modern API Protocols**
    - Looking at protocols beyond REST, such as **gRPC** and **GraphQL**.
- **Lecture 6: Summary & Practical Applications**
    - Concluding the section with a summary and discussion of practical applications.
