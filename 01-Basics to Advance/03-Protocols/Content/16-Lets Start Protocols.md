Hello everyone, and welcome to section three of our course.

This section is all about protocols.

In this section we will explore the core communication protocols that power modern system architecture

from TCP and UDP to HTTP, rest, WebSockets and beyond.

We'll break down how these protocols work, when to use them, and why they matter in the real world.

System design.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of the protocols that drive our web

applications, APIs, and real time communications.

Here in this section we are going to cover predominantly these protocols.

We'll start with the basics of TCP and UDP understanding their differences and their use cases.

Then we'll dive into HTTP which is the backbone of the web.

Next we'll explore Rest and API design principles followed by real time communication protocols like

WebSockets long pulling.

And then we will also look at some of the modern API protocols such as gRPC and GraphQL.

Finally, we'll wrap up with a summary and we'll discuss the practical application of these protocols.

This section will give you a strong foundation in protocols essential for system design.

So let's get started.
