All right, so we have reached to the end of this section on reliability, availability and disaster

recovery.

So let's try to quickly recap what we have covered in this section.

First we explored system reliability from core concepts like Mtbf, Mttr, and SLAs to understand the

importance of availability versus durability in system design, especially in case of cloud native and

distributed systems.

Next, we dove into high availability, fault tolerance, and failover strategies.

We learned how redundancy models like N plus one active active active passive, and why graceful degradation

is critical in maintaining service continuity.

We also touched on how health monitoring and self-healing systems are essential for resilience.

Then we examined backup and recovery strategies covering the different types of backups and the trade

offs between cost, complexity and recovery objectives.

We also discussed cloud based backup strategies that help streamline your recovery process.

Finally, we wrapped up with disaster Recovery in practice, where we looked at designing Der for mission

critical applications with insights from real world applications.

We also talked about the importance of combining failover and backup for complete resilience, along

with the need for testing, automation and addressing challenges in geo distributed system.

So in this section, we have laid the foundation for understanding the crucial elements needed to build

highly reliable, fault tolerant and resilient systems that can recover from disruptions effectively

and seamlessly.

This brings us to the end of this section on reliability.

What's in the next section?

In the next section, we will dive into security in system design, where we will cover how to protect

your systems against vulnerabilities, attacks and threats.

So I will see you in the next one.
