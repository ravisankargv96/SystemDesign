Here are the notes summarizing the **Architectural Patterns** section based on the provided files.

### **Section Summary: Architectural Patterns**

This section explored various architectural patterns, focusing on their impact on system scalability, maintainability, and performance. It covered how to choose the right pattern based on real-world use cases, best practices, and trade-offs.

#### **Key Architectural Patterns Covered**

- **Multi-Tier Architecture:**
    
    - **Concept:** A layered approach that structures applications into distinct layers such as presentation, business logic, and data.
        
    - **Benefits:** Facilitates scalability and ensures a clear separation of concerns.
        
- **Microservices Architecture:**
    
    - **Concept:** Breaks an application down into smaller, decoupled, and independent services.
        
    - **Benefits:** Enables independent scaling and deployment, improving flexibility.
        
    - **Challenges:** Introduces complexities such as distributed data consistency and observability.
        
- **Event-Driven Architecture:**
    
    - **Concept:** A system design relying on asynchronous processing where components are loosely coupled.
        
    - **Benefits:** Makes systems more responsive, scalable, and adaptable.
