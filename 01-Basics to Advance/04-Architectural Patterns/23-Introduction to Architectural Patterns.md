### **Introduction to Architectural Patterns**

What is Software Architecture?

Software architecture is defined as the fundamental structure of a system. It encompasses:

- How components are organized and how they interact with one another.
    
- The management of data flows, module dependencies, and communication between different parts of the system.

### **Key Design Considerations**

Architecture is critical because it directly influences system behavior. Successful design relies on three main pillars:

- **Scalability:** The system's ability to handle increasing amounts of data or user traffic without compromising performance.
    
- **Maintainability:** The ease with which a system can be updated, improved, or fixed (debugging) without causing major disruptions.
    
- **Performance:** The efficiency of the system under load, including how quickly it processes requests and responds to users.
    

> **Note:** Every decision, from database structure to choosing between monolithic or microservices approaches, impacts how the system behaves in production.

### **Section Agenda**

This section of the course will cover the following topics regarding modern system design:

1. **Software Architecture Patterns & Styles:** An overview of common styles such as Monolithic, Layered, and Client-Server.
    
2. **Multi-Tier Architecture:** A model used to separate application parts for improved scalability and maintainability.
    
3. **Microservices Architecture:** A deep dive into breaking systems into small, independent services to increase flexibility and resilience.
    
4. **Event-Driven Architecture:** building reactive, decoupled systems that respond to real-time events.
    
5. **Summary & Practical Applications:** How to choose and implement the right patterns effectively.
