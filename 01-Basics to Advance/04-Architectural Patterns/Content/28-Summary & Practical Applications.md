Right.

We are at the end of our Architectural pattern section.

Let's wrap up this section on architectural patterns by going over what we have learned and what's coming

next.

In this section, we explored different architectural patterns and how they impact system scalability,

maintainability, and performance.

We started with an introduction to architectural patterns, different patterns.

Then we looked at Multitier architecture, understanding how different layers like presentation, business

logic and data help structure applications.

Then we move to microservices architecture, where we saw how breaking an application into smaller,

independent services can improve flexibility and scalability.

But it also introduces additional challenges like distributed data consistency and observability.

Then we discussed event driven architecture, which enables asynchronous processing and loose coupling,

making systems more responsive and scalable.

Throughout this section, we examine real world use cases, best practices, and trade offs to help

us decide when to use each pattern.

So what's in the next section?

Next section we will move into Web Concepts and System Design, a foundational topic for understanding

how modern web applications work.

We'll cover how web operates, how to manage state data serialization techniques, security mechanisms

like cores, and key best practices for designing scalable web applications.

All these upcoming topics are essential topics for building reliable and efficient distributed system.

So I will see you in the next one.
