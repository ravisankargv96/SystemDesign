Hello and welcome to the next section of our course, Architectural Patterns and Styles.

In this section, we'll explore the core concepts behind software architecture, focusing on the most

common patterns and styles used in modern system design.

By the end of this section, you will understand the different architectural approaches, their advantages

and tradeoffs, and how to choose the right one for your system.

So let's get started.

So let's begin by understanding what software architecture really is.

At its core, software architecture refers to the structure of a system, how its components are organized,

and how they interact with each other.

This structure includes everything from data flows to module dependencies, and even the ways different

parts of the systems communicate.

Now, why does architecture matter?

Well, architecture has a profound impact on scalability, performance and maintainability of our application.

These are the pillars that ensure your system can handle growth, respond efficiently, and remain adaptable

over time.

When designing a system, it's critical to consider these three key design considerations.

Scalability is the system's ability to handle an increasing amount of data or user traffic without compromising

performance.

A scalable system can grow as your needs grow.

Maintainability is how easily can the system be updated or modified.

A well architected system is one that allows for easy updates, improvements, and bug fixes without

causing a major disruption then performance.

This refers to how efficiently the system performs under load, how quickly it processes requests and

respond to users, and how well it performs as the traffic increases.

Remember, the architectural choices you make directly influences the system behavior.

So every decision from whether you use a monolithic or microservices approach to how you structure your

databases, it will impact on how your system behaves in production.

So before diving deep into the details of upcoming lectures, let's take a moment to look at the agenda

for this section.

In this section we will be focusing on architectural patterns and styles.

It's a critical aspect of system design that shapes how systems are built and maintained.

Here is a quick overview of what we will be covering.

First, we will start with the introduction.

Next, we will dive into the software architecture patterns and styles where we will look at some common

architectural styles like monolithic layered, client server, microservices and event driven.

After that, we will explore multi-tier architecture, a model that is widely used in system design

to separate different parts of an application for better scalability and maintainability.

Then we will go deeper into microservices architecture, examining how breaking systems into smaller,

independent services offers flexibility, scalability and resilience.

Then we will also cover the event driven architecture, a pattern that focuses on building reactive

and decoupled systems that respond to events in real time.

Finally, we'll wrap up this section by looking at the summary and practical applications.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of how key architectural patterns are

used in modern system design, how to choose between them, and how to implement them effectively.

So let's get started.
