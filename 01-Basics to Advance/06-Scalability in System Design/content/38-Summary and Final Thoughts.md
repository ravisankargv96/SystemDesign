All right, so now we have reached to the end of section six.

In this section we have explored the core building blocks of scalability and scalability matters in

system design.

We started with an introduction to scalability, understanding why systems need to scale and the typical

challenges we face.

Then we explored scaling strategies horizontal, vertical and diagonal and when to use each depending

on your systems needs.

Then we dived into load balancing, covering types, common algorithms and how cloud platforms handle

traffic distribution.

Then finally, we wrapped up with auto scaling and best practices, looking at how modern cloud environments

automatically adjust resources for performance and cost efficiency.

That concludes the section six, which is the scalability section of this course.

Up next in the new section, we have database and storage where we look at how database is structured,

stored and scaled in distributed systems.

So I will see you in the next one.
