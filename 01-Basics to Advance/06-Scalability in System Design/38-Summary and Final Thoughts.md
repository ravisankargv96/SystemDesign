Here is the summary of **Section 6: Scalability in System Design**, based on the provided transcript.

### **Section Recap: Scalability Building Blocks**

This section focused on the core components required to build scalable systems that can handle growth efficiently.

- **Introduction to Scalability:** Covered the fundamental reasons why systems need to scale and the typical challenges faced during the process.
    
- **Scaling Strategies:** Explored when to apply different strategies based on system needs:
    
    - **Horizontal Scaling** (Scaling out).
        
    - **Vertical Scaling** (Scaling up).
        
    - **Diagonal Scaling** (Hybrid approach).
        
- **Load Balancing:** Examined different types of load balancers, common algorithms, and how cloud platforms manage traffic distribution.
    
- **Auto-scaling & Best Practices:** Wrapped up with how modern cloud environments automatically adjust resources to balance performance with cost efficiency.
