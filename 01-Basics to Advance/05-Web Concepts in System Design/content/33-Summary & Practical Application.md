Now we have completed this section on web Concepts in System Design.

In this section we explored fundamental web concepts essential for system design.

So let's quickly recap what we have covered in this section.

We started with the basics of how web applications work, covering the basic client server model, the

request response cycle, and the difference between stateless and stateful interactions.

We also emphasize the importance of security, scalability, and performance.

Then we looked at web sessions and how to manage state.

Since HTTP is stateless.

We discussed various ways to manage user sessions including cookies, server side sessions, JWT, and

token based authentication.

We also explored security concerns like session hijacking and CSRF, along with the best practices for

scalable session management.

Then we looked at serialization and data exchange.

We examined how data is structured and transmitted efficiently across systems.

We covered JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers discussing their tradeoffs in terms of readability, efficiency,

and compatibility.

We also saw how serialization is used in APIs, caching and databases.

Then we looked at cars and web security.

We tackled this cross-origin request sharing and same origin policy.

And we learned how Cors headers control access to resources and explore the security risks from misconfiguration

of cars.

We have also covered alternative approaches like reverse proxy and API gateway for handling Cross-origin

requests.

With this we wrap up section five.

These concepts are fundamental to building scalable and secure web applications.

In the next section, we move into an essential aspect of system design scalability.

As our system grows, handling increasing traffic and data efficiently becomes critical.

In this section, we will explore what scalability is, why it matters, and the key strategies for

scaling systems effectively.

We will dive into concepts like load balancing, horizontal and vertical scaling, auto scaling, cloud

based scaling and we will also look at the challenges and best practices to ensure high availability

and performance.

So I will see you in the next one.
