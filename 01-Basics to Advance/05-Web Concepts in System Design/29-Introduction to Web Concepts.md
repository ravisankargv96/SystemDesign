Here are the notes for **Section 5: Web Concepts in System Design**, based on the provided lecture materials.

### **Introduction to Web Concepts**

This section focuses on the fundamental principles that power modern web applications. Understanding how web applications work is essential for designing efficient, scalable, and secure systems.

### **Why Learn Web Concepts?**

- **Foundation of Modern Apps:** The web serves as the backbone for major systems, including social media platforms, e-commerce applications, and cloud services.
    
- **System Design Interviews:** These concepts are frequently tested in technical interviews, specifically topics such as managing state, handling cross-origin requests, and optimizing data exchange.
    
- **Large-Scale Reliance:** Almost every large-scale system relies on web-based architecture.
    

### **Key Design Pillars**

A well-designed web system must address three critical pillars:

- **Scalability:** The ability to handle millions of users efficiently.
    
- **Security:** Preventing vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access.
    
- **Performance:** Ensuring fast response times to provide a seamless user experience.
    

### **Section Agenda**

This section will cover the following key topics:

**1. Web Sessions: Managing State**

- This module explores how to manage state within the stateless environment of HTTP.
    
- It covers specific techniques including cookies, sessions, and token-based authentication.
    
- It also addresses the challenges and best practices for scaling session management.
    

**2. Serialization: Data Exchange**

- This topic covers how data is formatted for exchange between clients and servers.
    
- It compares common formats such as JSON, XML, and Protocol Buffers.
    
- The comparison focuses on trade-offs regarding efficiency, readability, and compatibility.
    

**3. CORS & Web Security**

- This module tackles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and the Same-Origin Policy.
    
- It explains why CORS is necessary, how it functions, and best practices for handling cross-origin requests securely.
    

**4. Summary & Practical Applications**

- The section concludes with a summary of key takeaways and real-world applications.
    
- It also reviews common interview questions related to web concepts and effective strategies for answering them.
