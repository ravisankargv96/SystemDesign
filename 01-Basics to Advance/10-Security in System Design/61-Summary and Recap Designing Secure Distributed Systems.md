All right, so we have reached to the end of this section of security and system design.

Let's do a quick recap of what we have covered in this section on security and system design.

Well, first in distributed system security is paramount.

We have seen how the CIA triad confidentiality, integrity and availability forms the foundation of

security principles.

Protecting sensitive data and ensuring that it remains intact and accessible is crucial for any system.

Then we have explored some common threats like DDoS, man in the middle, injection and spoofing.

Understanding these help us anticipate and prevent potential vulnerabilities.

Moving on to authentication and authorization, we have learned about various authentication methods

like Oauth2, OpenID, JWT, which ensures that only authorized users gain access.

We also covered access control models using Rbac, a bag, and so which help us enforce appropriate

access policies across the system.

In data protection and secure communication, we looked at strategies to encrypt data both at rest and

in transit.

This includes technologies like TLS, SSL, Https, and techniques like hashing and salting passwords,

ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains secure.

Then, for network and infrastructure security, we discussed key techniques such as firewalls, reverse

proxies, and rate limiting to control traffic and prevent abuse.

Network segmentation and the zero Trust model help isolate critical components and ensure that no part

of the system is trusted by default.

Finally, we looked at cloud microservices security with a focus on IAM encryption and securing communications

via API gateways.

This concludes this section on security in system design.

Now what is coming up next?

Well, before starting the actual case studies and actual system design interviews, we will try to

go through the System Design blueprint.

So in the next section we will explore the System Design Blueprint which will serve as a comprehensive

framework for all system design interviews.

This blueprint will guide you through the entire system design process.

In the interviews and beyond.

So I will see you in the next one.
