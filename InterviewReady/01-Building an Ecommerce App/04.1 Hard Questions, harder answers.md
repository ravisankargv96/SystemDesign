## 🧭 **00:00 – Engineering Questions**

* The founder is satisfied with reduced support costs but returns with **subjective engineering questions**, such as:

  * “Should we move to a microservice architecture?”
  * “Should we use Node.js or Python instead of Java or Go?”

### 🎯 Role of the Engineering Manager

* Provide **balanced, data-backed guidance** rather than subjective opinions.
* Consider **both technical and business perspectives** — developer productivity, hiring ease, training cost, scalability, and performance.

## 🏗️ **00:53 – Monolith or Microservices?**

### **When NOT to Use Microservices**

* Team size < **10–15 engineers**.
* No multiple office locations or distributed teams.
* The system is **still small and evolving rapidly**.

### **Guideline**

* Start with a **monolith** for simplicity, speed, and cost control.
* Move to **microservices** only when scaling or team coordination becomes difficult.

🧩 **Principle:**

> Don’t adopt microservices for trendiness — adopt them for necessity (scaling, isolation, ownership).

## 💻 **01:27 – Choice of Language**

### **Typical Question:**

> “Is Node.js / Python fast enough compared to Java or Go?”

### **Response Framework:**

1. **Performance:**

   * Node.js/Python are **2–4× slower** in raw compute vs optimized languages (Go/Java).
   * Means **higher cloud cost** for the same workload (more parallel servers / serverless invocations).

2. **Hiring & Training Costs:**

   * Easier hiring, faster onboarding for popular languages.
   * Offset slower performance with **cheaper, faster developer ramp-up**.

3. **Migration Costs:**

   * Include **code rewrite time + training + testing + downtime**.
   * Often unjustified for small teams unless long-term ROI is clear.

🧮 **Rule of Thumb:**

> Consider *total cost of ownership* — not just technical performance.

## 💰 **02:35 – Cost Estimation**

### **Scenario:**

Founder wants to add a “**try-on T-shirt with camera**” feature.

#### **Steps to Estimate Cost:**

4. **Implementation Cost:**

   * Engineering effort (person-days).
   * Integration complexity.

5. **Usage Cost:**

   * Assume 10,000 daily users → 10% (1,000) use the try-on feature.
   * 1,000 API calls/day × cost per API × 30 days = **monthly compute cost**.

6. **Storage Cost:**

   * Each video ~1 MB → 1 GB/day = ~30 GB/month.
   * Multiply by S3 storage cost/GB.
   * Optimizations (compression, batching) possible later.

#### **Decision Process:**

* Step 1: Implement simplest version meeting all requirements.
* Step 2: Measure actual usage and costs.
* Step 3: Optimize only if costs are unacceptable.

🧠 **Concept:** “Back-of-the-envelope” estimations help align **engineering, finance, and product** teams early.

## 📊 **05:23 – Capacity Estimation**

### **What to Estimate:**

* Data size & storage (GB/month).
* Memory consumption per request.
* Bandwidth usage.
* Number of servers / containers / Lambda calls required.

### **Purpose:**

* Plan infrastructure budgets.
* Identify scaling thresholds.
* Make **data-driven architecture decisions**.

## 🔗 **05:57 – APIs and SLAs**

### **Core Advice:**

> “How you write the code matters less than how you **expose it**.”

### **Key Focus:**

* Define **clear, consistent, simple API contracts**.
* Avoid complex or ambiguous APIs (e.g., PayPal analogy).
* Good API design → faster developer onboarding, fewer errors, better integrations.

### **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):**

* Set expectations for:

  * **Availability** (e.g., 99.9% uptime)
  * **Latency / Response times**
  * **Error rates**
* SLAs communicate **reliability and professionalism** to partners and users.

✅ **Principle Summary:**

| Focus         | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **APIs**      | Define how others interact with your system |
| **Contracts** | Ensure clarity & backward compatibility     |
| **SLAs**      | Quantify reliability commitments            |
